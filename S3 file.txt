Narrative Essays: This is when the writer is narrating an incident or story through the essay. 
So these are in the first person. The aim when writing narrative essays is to involve the reader
 in them as if they were right there when it was happening. So make them as vivid and real as possible.
 One way to make this possible is to follow the principle of ‘show, don’t tell’. 
So you must involve the reader in the story.

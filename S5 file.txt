This is the last paragraph of the essay. 
Sometimes a conclusion will just mirror the introductory paragraph 
but make sure the words and syntax are different. 
A conclusion is also a great place to sum up a story or an argument. 
You can round up your essay by providing some moral or wrapping up a story. 
Make sure you complete your essays with the conclusion, leave no hanging threads.
